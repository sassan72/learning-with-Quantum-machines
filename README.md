This repository contains source codes for our study, which is currently under consideration at the European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (EJNMMI) titled: Error mitigation enables radiomic prostate cancer characterization of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI patients on real quantum computers. Once our paper is accepted, we will update this page.
The study was conducted by the Applied Quantum Computing group, Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.
For the anonymized PSMA-11 primary prostate IBSI-conform radiomic dataset this study relied on see: https://osf.io/3nkx8/
